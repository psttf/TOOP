# TOOP: a Sigma Calculus Interpreter

This is an interpreter for object-oriented sigma calculus described in

> M. Abadi, L. Cardelli. A theory of objects. â€“ Springer Berlin, 1996. 

The interpreter is available online at

> http://toop-sigma.herokuapp.com/

and is used during the Object-Oriented Programming MSc course
at the Cybernetics dept. of
[NRNU MEPhI](https://eng.mephi.ru/).

Implementation language is [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and
the project is built with [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).

## Alternatives

We've found the following alternative interpreters:

*	http://types.bu.edu/seminar-ool-mini/sigma.html
*	http://sigmaid.gforge.inria.fr
* https://github.com/slomo/simigma

Unfortunately, none of them has an online interface.
